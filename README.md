![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)


My challenge was to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Users are able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
